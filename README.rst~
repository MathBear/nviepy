Overview
---------
NviePy (Numerical VIEs in Python) is a Python package for
creating order conditions and order trees.
Is a generator of trees and order conditions for  Runge-Kutta VIE methods, and some examples in solving symbolically the order conditions
It is inspired by NodePy, and extends his functionality in creating order trees and order conditions for VIEs.

It could be extended in order to have the same, ore more, functionalities as the original package;
i.e. designing, analyzing,  and testing numerical methods for VIEs of the second type.


The development version can be obtained from
