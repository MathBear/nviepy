Overview
---------

NviePy (Numerical VIEs in Python) is a Python package for
creating order conditions and order trees.
It is inspired by NodePy, and extends his functionality in creating order trees and order conditions for VIEs.

It could be extended in order to have the same, ore more, functionalities as the original package;
i.e. designing, analyzing,  and testing numerical methods for VIEs of the second type.


Its development was
motivated by my own research in time integration methods for PDEs. I found that
I was frequently repeating tasks that could be automated and integrated.
Initially I developed a collection of MATLAB scripts, but this became unwieldy
due to the large number of files that were necessary and the more limited
capability for code reuse.

NodePy represents an object-oriented approach, in which the basic object is a
numerical ODE solver. The idea is to design a laboratory for such methods in
the same sense that MATLAB is a laboratory for matrices.
